# About me

Positive professional with a passion for software applications and cultivating relationships. I'm currently seeking a Software Engineer position that will allow me to build, develop and ship customized software solutions to various clients and business partners. With my unique background in Computer Science and Sales, I can be the perfect fit between your Business and Sales team and your Engineering department. Feel Free to contact me.  Currently pursuing a Master Degree in Software Engineering at SJSU.

In my free time, I'm an avid tennis player, board game enthusiast while always looking to spend my time outdoors. Looking forward to exploring the coast along Route 1 in California after the pandemic subsides. I also never shy away from finding a new great place to eat.
